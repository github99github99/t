Hi! âœ‹
I had similar problem and solved it following this steps before gulp watch.

download or clone repository

cd direcotry-to-potree-main-folder>
npm install --save
npm install -g gulp
npm install -g rollup
npm i natives
gulp watch

Hope this helps ðŸ˜„




I was getting this error while I was using Gulp 3.9.1 and NodeJS 12.14.0.

I have solved uninstalling NodeJS 12.14.0 and installing NodeJS 10.13.0 version.

Then everything worked properly.
